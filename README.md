# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **JavaScript**. This project demonstrates how to build an interactive and simple game using React's component-based architecture and TypeScript for type safety.

## About the Project  
This project is a digital version of the popular **Tic-Tac-Toe** game where two players take turns marking a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (X or O). The game is designed to be played in the browser with real-time interactions. It is a great project for practicing state management, handling user input, and integrating React with TypeScript.

The app includes features such as restarting the game, displaying the winner, and preventing further moves once the game is over.

## Features
- **Playable Grid**: A 3x3 grid for players to mark their moves.
- **Player Turns**: Alternates between two players (X and O).
- **Game Status**: Displays whose turn it is and who the winner is.
- **Restart Button**: Resets the game to start a new round.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is fully responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **TypeScript Support**: Utilizes TypeScript for static typing and type safety.
